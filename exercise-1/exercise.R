# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000

# Create a variable `max_puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1K.  Compute this
# value in R, not just assign!

hometown <- "Kanpur"
my.name <- "Sachin"
my.height <- 5.8
puppies <- 2
puppy.price <- 200
total.cost <- puppy.price * puppies
too.expensive <- total.cost > 1000
max_puppies <- 1000 / puppy.price
